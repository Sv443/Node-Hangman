## Build instructions:
To build Node-Hangman from source, follow these steps:
1. Make sure at least a semi-recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (I recommend v12 or higher) is installed on your system
2. Run the command `npm i` to install all the dependencies
3. Build the executable file by running the command `npm run build`
<!--3. Install the npm package [`pkg`](https://npmjs.com/package/pkg) with the command `npm i -g pkg`-->

(If `pkg` couldn't be found, use `npm i -g pkg` to install it)
